# CoolCalc — A small modern calculator

This is a small frontend calculator app built for the UCS 745 assignment. It demonstrates a simple project you can manage with Git/GitHub, and is ideal for intentionally creating merge conflicts (see Git steps below).

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a simple HTTP server).
2. Use the buttons or keyboard to compute expressions.
3. Keyboard: digits, `+ - * / % ( )`, `Enter` to evaluate, `Backspace` to edit, `c` to clear.

## Merge Conflict (assignment specific)
"Conflict created by Feature B"
